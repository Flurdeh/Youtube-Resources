# Screen Recording Software
If you want to record a video game on your computer, or just your computer in general. You will need a screen recorder. Honestly, there really are very few choices that are worth considering.
## Free

 - [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/) - `Windows/Mac/Linux` This is probably the most common recommendation when it comes to screen recorders, and honestly? The only one to seriously consider. Lots of options and also allows you to stream. This really is the most obvious choice. [(Quick Start Guide)](https://obsproject.com/wiki/OBS-Studio-Quickstart). There is another version called [Streamlabs OBS](https://streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs) that is more geared towards streamers.

 - [Nvidia Shadowplay](https://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/) - `Windows` You probably already have this on your computer if you have an Nvidia graphics card, but there aren't many options. You press a button and it records you whole screen. That's all there is to it.
 
## Paid

- [Bandicam](https://www.bandicam.com/) - `Windows` 
# Video Editing Software
Many years ago, all you had to worry about was Windows Movie Maker. We live in more civilized times now and there are many more options for the average person to edit their videos in.

## Free
- [Hitfilm Express](https://fxhome.com/hitfilm-express) - `Windows/Mac` A good program to start with, looks similar to more professional software like Adobe Premiere and is a good stepping stone towards it if you want you to switch to it later.
 
- [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/nl/products/davinciresolve/) - `Windows/Mac/Linux` Just like Hitfilm, its a good stepping stone to some paid software. Resolve has plenty of advanced features in the free version, but also has a paid version.

- [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) - `Mac` Great software for apple users. 

- [Openshot](https://www.openshot.org/download/) - `Windows/Mac/Linux`

- [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/) - `Windows/Mac/Linux`

## Paid
- Adobe Premiere / After Effects
- [Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/)
