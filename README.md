# Screen Recording Software
If you want to record a video game on your computer, or just your computer in general. You will need a screen recorder. Honestly, there really are very few choices that are worth considering.
## Free

 - [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/) `Windows/Mac/Linux` - This is probably the most common recommendation when it comes to screen recorders, and honestly? The only one to seriously consider. Lots of options and also allows you to stream. This really is the most obvious choice. [(Quick Start Guide)](https://obsproject.com/wiki/OBS-Studio-Quickstart). There is another version called [Streamlabs OBS](https://streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs) that is more geared towards streamers.

 - [Nvidia Shadowplay](https://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/) `Windows` - You probably already have this on your computer if you have an Nvidia graphics card, but there aren't many options. You press a button and it records you whole screen. That's all there is to it.
 
## Paid

- [Bandicam](https://www.bandicam.com/) `Windows` 

# Audio Recording & Editing Software
There aren't too many of these that I know of. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is probably the most popular option here. If you have Adobe's Creative Cloud, [Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) might be worth a peek.

# Video Editing Software
Many years ago, all you had to worry about was Windows Movie Maker. We live in more civilized times now and there are many more options for the average person to edit their videos in.

## Free
- [Hitfilm Express](https://fxhome.com/hitfilm-express) `Windows/Mac` - A good program to start with, looks similar to more professional software like Adobe Premiere and is a good stepping stone towards it if you want you to switch to it later.
 
- [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/nl/products/davinciresolve/) `Windows/Mac/Linux` -  Just like Hitfilm, its a good stepping stone to some paid software. Resolve has plenty of advanced features in the free version, but also has a paid version.

- [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) `Mac` - Great software for apple users. 

- [KDENLive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) `Windows/Linux` - A very full-featured open source video editor that has many professional features built in, as well as a library of compositing effects, and support for custom transistion masks. 
-  [Avid Media Composer](https://www.avid.com/media-composer) `Windows/Mac` - Has a more basic free version with and a paid version.

- [Openshot](https://www.openshot.org/download/) `Windows/Mac/Linux` 

- [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/) `Windows/Mac/Linux`
- [Olive](https://www.olivevideoeditor.org/index.php) `Windows/Mac/Linux` - Newer video editor currently in alpha


## Paid
- [Adobe Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) / [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) `Windows/Mac` - Great software, but as with any adobe product, you pay a hefty price for it.

- [Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) `Windows` - Has been around for a while, keep an eye out on Humble Bundle, as they generally have a bundle with Vegas Pro about twice a year.
-  [Avid Media Composer](https://www.avid.com/media-composer) `Windows/Mac` - Has a more basic free version with and a paid version.

- [Apple Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/nl/final-cut-pro/) `Mac`

## Mobile
I don't know much about mobile editors, but these are some of the ones I've found in my search for this list. Its a mix of free and paid software considering most of these have different versions.

- [Inshot](https://inshot.com/) `Android/iOS`
- [Kinemaster](https://www.kinemaster.com/) `Android/iOS` - Has some limits on the free version like video length. 
- [Adobe Premiere Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html) `Android/iOS` - Adobe's premiere but simplified for mobile. 
- [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193) `iOS` - Apple's video editor is also available for Iphone/Ipad.
# Image editing software
Creating thumbnails, a banner, and a logo are important parts of your YouTube channel. These are some image editing softwares you can use.
## Free
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) `Windows/Mac/Linux` - Has been around forever as a Photoshop alternative. Open source and very popular.
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/create/youtube-thumbnails/) `Web Browser` - Free web based image editor. Has some templates to choose from to make things easier. Also has a premium version with more options.
- [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) `Web browser` - Has been making a name for itself. Completely web browser based, no need to download anything.

- [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) `Windows` - Also has been around for years. A bit more lightweight than GIMP but can still do a decent enough job.

## Paid
- [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) `Windows/Mac` - Everybody and their mother knows Photoshop. Adobe offers a subscription for Photoshop+Lightroom that is cheaper than their Creative Cloud subscription.

- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) `Windows/Mac` - Looks similar-ish to Photoshop and is more geared to photo editing but can definitely do thumbnails. One time purchase.
# Music & Sounds
A very common question being asked when making videos on YouTube is "How do I know what music I can use?" and "Where can I find music for my videos?" YouTube's [audio library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music) is a good place to start. YouTube used to have a page where you could look what the licenses of music was, but they've retired it with the introduction of the new creator studio.

**A common misconception when searching for music is that people look for royalty free music. Please note that this is not copyright free, and can still fall under copyrighted content. See [here](https://www.dl-sounds.com/copyright-free-vs-royalty-free).**

# Stock Footage
Sometimes you need video footage of things you can't film yourself. If this is the case, stock footage can be very handy to use. But often this footage can be extremely expensive, luckily, there are plenty of websites that can provide you with footage just as good without having to pay anything. Some of these don't even need credit. **Despite what the description of each website says, it is a good idea to double check on the website what the license is.**
