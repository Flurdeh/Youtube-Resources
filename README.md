# Screen Recording Software
If you want to record a video game on your computer, or just your computer in general. You will need a screen recorder. Honestly, there really are very few choices that are worth considering.
## Free

 - [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/) - `PC/Mac/Linux` This is probably the most common recommendation when it comes to screen recorders. Lots of options and also allows you to stream. This really is the most obvious choice. [(Quick Start Guide)](https://obsproject.com/wiki/OBS-Studio-Quickstart). There is another version called [Streamlabs OBS](https://streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs) that is more geared towards streamers.

 - [Nvidia Shadowplay](https://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/) - You probably already have this on your computer if you have an Nvidia graphics card, but there aren't many options. You press a button and it records you whole screen. That's all there is to it.
